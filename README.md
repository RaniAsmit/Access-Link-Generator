# ⏳ TIMELY — Time-Limited Access Link Generator

> *One link. One shot. One moment in time.*


## ✨ What is TIMELY?

**TIMELY** is not just a backend tool — it’s your **digital gatekeeper**.

Whether you’re sharing a private document, giving limited-time access to an internal service, or creating temporary event invitations — **TIMELY makes sure the door closes exactly when you want it to.**

Built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**, it generates unique, self-expiring URLs you can trust — with seconds-to-days level precision.

## 🧠 Why TIMELY?

Forget about lingering links and stale URLs. TIMELY is designed for moments that **shouldn’t last forever**.

- 🔐 **Secure by Default** – Each link comes with a one-time-use token and a precise TTL.
- 🕒 **Time-Aware** – You choose how long the door stays open: 10 seconds, 10 minutes, 10 days.
- 🧾 **Track Everything** – Every request, expiration, and access attempt is tracked in the database.
- ⚙️ **Developer-Friendly** – RESTful API with clean Swagger documentation, ready to integrate.
- 🧊 **Minimalist Frontend** – Just enough UI to get the job done without distractions.

> 🧩 Think of it like a temporary bridge — TIMELY builds it, walks them across, then burns it behind them.
